			 Ad hoc bug tracking

These should be converted into tests, if possible.

* TODO mirror instantiation fails if network is down

We shouldn't need the network just to work out our capture list, for instance.

* TODO mirror is filling in forward order

Should fill in reverse order

* TODO tweeze out local mirror config from site configuration -- make global
* TODO mock or provide local mirror storage for github actions

This should enable us to revert the following commits, which merely
disable tests which would otherwise work:
 - 1dc26ecea138d3569b1892395ffb4c7f95209b42
 - df4aabb289c08b9020d96747b9dbbefaabc9f2dd

* TODO operation testing and bug chasing
** TODO sdo
** TODO goes
* TODO local destination storage abstraction

E.g. s3.

* TODO start playback side

Organize project for playback and shared.

* TODO convert to git / github
